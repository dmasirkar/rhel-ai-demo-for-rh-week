     CVE-2024-38473 is a flaw was found in the mod_proxy module of httpd. Due to an encoding problem, specially crafted request URLs with incorrect encoding can be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication.
     This issue affects configurations where mechanisms other than ProxyPass/ProxyPassMatch or RewriteRule with the 'P' flag are used to configure a request to be proxied.The CVE-2024-38473 is fixed in httpd-2.4.57-11.el9_4 package version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9.4 and later. If the system is not already updated to latest version of httpd then use following command to update httpd package to the latest version: # dnf update httpd For more details refer Red Hat Security Advisory https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2024:4726.

      CVE-2024-42244 is about usb serial driver mos7840 which crashes on resume.
      Since commit c49cfa917025 ("USB: serial: use generic method if no
      alternative is provided in usb serial layer"), USB serial core calls the
      generic resume implementation when the driver has not provided one. This
      can trigger a crash on resume with mos7840 since support for multiple read
      URBs was added back in 2011. Specifically, both port read URBs are now
      submitted on resume for open ports,however the context pointer of
      second URB is left to point to the core rather than mos7840 structure.
      This is fixed by implementing dedicated suspend and resume functions for
      mos7840.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is commit c49cfa917025?
        answer: >-
          Its a kernel commit about using generic method if no alternative is
          provided in usb serial layer.
      - question: What is mos7840?
        answer: mos7840 is a usb serial driver.
      - question: Where does present context pointer of second URB points?
        answer: >-
          The context pointer of the second URB is set to the core rather than
          mos7840 port structure.
      - question: what new functions are provided in order to fix CVE-2024-42244
        answer: >-
          To fix this CVE a dedicated suspend and resume function are provided
          for mos7840 driver.
      - question: when was the support for multiple read URBs added in mos7840
          driver?
        answer: >-
          In 2011 this function was added.

      1. Description

         A flaw was found in OpenSSL's RFC7250 Raw Public Key (RPK) authentication.
         This vulnerability allows man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via failure
         to abort TLS/DTLS handshakes when the server's RPK does not match the
         expected key despite the SSL\_VERIFY\_PEER verification mode being set.

      2. Statement

         The version of OpenSSL in RHEL-9.5 is affected by this vulnerability.
         However, earlier releases of OpenSSL in RHEL are not affected. This
         issue was introduced in the initial implementation of RPK support in
         OpenSSL 3.2.

         RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The
         issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the
         server, and the server, likewise, enables sending of an RPK instead of
         an X.509 certificate chain. The affected clients are those that then
         rely on the handshake to fail when the server's RPK fails to match one
         of the expected public keys, by setting the verification mode to
         SSL\_VERIFY\_PEER.

         Clients that enable server-side raw public keys can still find out that
         raw public key verification failed by calling SSL\_get\_verify\_result(),
         and those that do, and take appropriate action, are not affected.

         rhel9/ruby-33 & ubi9/ruby-33 are not affected because RPK is not present
         in any form or as any function that could be called from Ruby via Red Hat
         supported RPMs in RHEL.

         For example the SSL\_dane\_enable or SSL\_add\_expected\_rpk or
         X509\_STORE\_CTX\_get0\_rpk or X509\_STORE\_CTX\_init\_rpk
         (and more rpk-related) functions are not callable from Ruby.

      3. Solution

         CVE-2024-12797 is fixed in openssl-3.2.2-6.el9\_5.1 package version.

         If the system is not already updated to latest version then refer command
         as follows.

           \# dnf update openssl

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          CVE-2024-12797 is fixed in which rpm package in RHEL 9?
        answer: |
          In RHEL 9, CVE-2024-12797 has been fixed in Openssl rpm package version
          \"openssl-3.2.2-6.el9\_5.1\". Update using command.

           \# dnf update openssl
      - question: |
          Describle the flaw in CVE-2024-12797 briefly?
        answer: |
          CVE-2024-12797 is about a flaw in OpenSSL's RFC7250 Raw Public Key (RPK)
          authentication related to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via failure
          to abort TLS/DTLS handshakes when the server's RPK does not match the
          expected key despite the SSL\_VERIFY\_PEER verification mode being set.
      - question: |
          How CVE-2024-12797 affects RHEL 9?
        answer: |
          In RHEL-9.5 OpenSSL version is affeced by vulnerability mentioned in
          CVE-2024-12797. Earlier releases of OpenSSL in RHEL are not affected.
          The issue was introduced in RPK support in Openssl 3.2.

          RPKs are disabled by default in both TLS clients and TLS servers. The
          issue only arises when TLS clients explicitly enable RPK use by the
          server.

      The vulnerability i.e. CVE-2023-48795 is also referred to as terrapin
      attack. This affects openssh packages on RHEL. A flaw was found in the SSH
      channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during the handshake,
      an attacker can remove the initial messages on the secure channel without
      causing a MAC failure.  The most significant identified impact is that it
      enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before
      authentication begins. No other observable impact on session.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is CVE-2023-48795 ?

          Vulnerability reported for openssh package on RHEL. A flaw was found
          in the SSH channel integrity. By manipulating sequence numbers during
          the handshake, an attacker can remove the initial messages on the
          secure channel. Also called terrapin attack.
      - question: >-
          What is impact of CVE-2023-48795 or terrapin attack vulnerability on
          RHEL 9 system ?
        answer: >-
          The most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to
          delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication
          begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke
          timing obfuscation features. No impact for sessions.
      - question: What are mitigation steps for CVE-2023-48795 ?
        answer: >-
          You can disable affected ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8
          and RHEL-9. You can apply a subpolicy to disable CHACHA20-POLY1305
          cipher and set ssh_etm=0. This can be done using sub-policy in
          cryptographic policy. Detailed steps in CVE page.

          Red Hat takes a fix for a security flaw out of the most recent version
          of an upstream software package, and applies that fix to an older
          version of the package distributed by Red Hat. Avoid using upstream
          package version, only use Red Hat packages.

      Samba is a standard interoperability software suite integrated in Windows, a reimplementation of the server message block (SMB) networking protocol for file and print services. It runs on most Unix and Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS systems, amongst other versions and operating systems (OS) that use the SMB/Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol. This allows network administrators to configure, integrate, and set up equipment either as a domain controller (DC) or domain member, and to communicate with Windows-based clients.

      - question: |
          How can I fix samba vulnerability or CVE?
        answer: |
          Fixing Samba vulnerabilities (CVEs) involves several steps, depending on the specific CVE affecting your system.
      - question: |
          How can I fix samba CVE-2023-3347?
        answer: |
          The SMB2 packet signing is not enforced if an admin configured "server signing = required" or for SMB2 connections to Domain Controllers where SMB2 packet signing is mandatory.
